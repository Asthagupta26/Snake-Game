A classic Snake Game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows users to control the snake, eat food, and grow while avoiding collisions with the walls and itself.

*   Snake grows as it eats food
*   Score tracking based on how much food is eaten
*   Game-over state when the snake collides with itself or the walls
*   Responsive layout for different screen sizes


Technologies Used

*   **CSS3**: Styling the game board, snake, and food.
*   **JavaScript**: Game logic (movement, collision detection, score tracking).
